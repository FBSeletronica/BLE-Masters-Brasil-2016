# BLE Battery Status Demo  


*  Device:    [PIC16F1619](http://microchip.com/pic16f161x)
*  Board:     [PICDEM Curiosity (DM164137)](http://microchip.com/curiosity)
*  Tools:     [MPLAB X , XC8 and MPLAB Code Configurator](htto://microchip.com/mplabx)

## The Basic Idea
* Connect your phone/ipad to the Curiosity board and visualise the position of the potentiometer (or other analog input) as the (Curiosity) Battery status. 

* You will need:
    * RN4020 [BLE2 ClickÂ©](http://mikroe.com/click/ble2) board
    
 
## Software Implementation 
* This demo implements the simplest possible set of commands to get the RN4020 going
* This demo does not use the MLDP (serial emulation) mode
* but only the standard GATT Battery Status service/characteristic
